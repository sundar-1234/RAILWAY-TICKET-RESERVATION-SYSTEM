# RAILWAY-TICKET-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
This is a console-based Java application that simulates a railway ticket booking system. It allows users to book, cancel, and view tickets using a simple menu-driven interface. The project handles confirmed bookings, RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation), and waiting list tickets â€” just like a real-world railway reservation system.
